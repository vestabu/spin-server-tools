This project hosts collaborative efforts in bringing a full enterprise application server stack to the embedded web server developed jointly by Parallax and WIZnet.
The server supports a standard TCP/IP protocol stack
The CPU is a Parallax Propeller 32-bit/8-core parallel processor running at 80MHz.  This processor is interfaced to a WIZnet W5100 10BaseT wired ethernet controller chip.

This open source project has currently started as of Nov 2010 at the following forum at Parallax Inc.
